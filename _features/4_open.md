  Draves was an early enthusiast and contributor to <a
  href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source</a> and the first to make
  Open Source art. Because his code was freely useable and improvable,
  his algorithms were widely adopted and became a recognizable style
  of their own.

<p>
  His generative algorithms are widely used commercially,
  artistically, and by personal enthusiasts of all stripes. In
  addition to the Paul Simon album cover and Stephen Hawking book
  cover depicted below, other prominent examples include a
  Super Bowl commerical by IBM, the Natalie Portman movie Annihilation, and Peter
  Chung's short in "The Animatrix".
